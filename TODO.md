Diagram your App:

What components will you have?
Where would state "live"?
Where would you setup useEffect?
Where do you need to pass props?
Where do you need to make the API call?

Minimum of 3 components:
A single gif should rendered when the page initially loads (ComponentDidMount)
On Button click make another API call update state with the new Gif
Render only a single gif at a time
